            <h2>Overview of Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>Technological innovations bring ethical dilemmas related to data privacy, accessibility, and job displacement. Let’s look at the key ethical concerns:</p>

            <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
            <p>As companies gather vast amounts of user data, privacy concerns grow. For instance, Facebook has faced scrutiny over its handling of user data. Compliance with regulations like GDPR is essential to protect user privacy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>85% of consumers are concerned about data privacy in social media apps.</li>
                <li>GDPR fines totaled $1 billion globally in 2022, showing regulators’ commitment to protecting data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
            <p>The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not. With 2.9 billion people still offline, the lack of access limits economic and educational opportunities. Efforts to provide affordable internet access are critical to bridging this divide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>50% of rural areas lack reliable internet access.</li>
                <li>UNICEF’s Digital Inclusion initiative aims to connect underserved communities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Job Displacement</h3>
            <p>Automation threatens traditional jobs, making it crucial for companies to retrain displaced workers. A McKinsey report suggests 375 million workers may need to switch roles by 2030 due to automation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>45% of current jobs may be automated within the next 20 years.</li>
                <li>Companies like IBM are investing in employee retraining to prepare for the future.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Evaluation of Ethical Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Different stakeholders view these issues differently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business Perspective:</strong> Innovation is often seen as a pathway to profit, with a focus on efficiency and cost reduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Perspective:</strong> Consumers prioritize privacy and transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Bodies:</strong> Regulators aim to ensure that technological advances respect ethical standards and rights.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Balancing these perspectives is essential. Companies like IBM and Google are making strides in developing ethical AI and supporting workers through retraining programs, setting standards for responsible innovation.</p>
